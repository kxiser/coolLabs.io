# About us <img class="inline-flex w-10 h-10" src="/images/facts/about.svg">
 
Our mission to empower people to use products that are:

- __Independent of large companies or any 3rd parties__.
- __Privacy focused__.
- __Community-driven__.

<br/>


## Why we doing it?
We believe, everyone has the right to control their own online information and we would like to provide such place to do so with our products.

<br/>

- No hard to understand privacy policies - every application have a simple detailed list of collected information.
- Not backed by any big companies - we are a bootstrapped company.
- Not selling & sending any of your data to other companies or servers.

<br/>


In the other hand, we love coding! <img class="inline-flex w-5 h-5" src="/images/facts/fire.svg">
