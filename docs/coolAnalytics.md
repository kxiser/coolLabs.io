#  coolAnalytics
A cool trend analytics for your websites, without tracking users.

## What we collect?
In addition to the [general data we collect during registration](/docs/#what-we-collect):

### User Agent
We **collect**, but store **anonymized** your browser's User Agent in our database.

__Why?__ To measure browser types.

<br/>

__What anonymized storing means?__

We do not store the whole user agent, just:

<br/>

- **Browser Name**, for visitor's browser analytics.
- **Browser Version**, for future trends analytics.
- **OS Name**, for future trend analytics.
- **OS Version**, for future trend analytics.

<hr/>

### Timezone
We **collect** and **store** your Time Zone in our database.

__Why?__ To measure the visitor's country.

<hr/>

### Screen Width
We **collect** and **store** your device's screen width `asd` in our database.

__Why?__ To measure the visitor's device type.
