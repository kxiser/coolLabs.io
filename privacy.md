Privacy & transparency are our main keystones. 

<br/>
<br/>

coolLabs ("we", "us", or "our") creating our services and applications to make place where your data is secured and not transferred to other companies. This is applicable for all coollabs.io domains and subdomains (for example note.coollabs.io) which we own and operate.   

<br/>
<br/>


There could be links to external sites which are not operated by us, so please be aware!

<br/>

To make these services functional, we collect some basic information, but only those which are necessary for our own products to work, nothing more. If technically possible, we anonymize this information.

<br/>

Each product has it's own list of collected data. Read the corresponding [list here](docs/).

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions about data handling.

<br/>

We only store your collected information as long as it's necessary for your requested service.

<br/>

We do not share any information with 3rd parties, except if it's required by the law.

<br/>

You can always change your mind if you would not like to share your data with us. 
There is an option in every product, where you can delete your own information from our servers easily, with one click.

<br/>

If you continue to use our products, it means you are accepting this policy.
